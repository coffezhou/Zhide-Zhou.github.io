Dr. Zhide Zhou is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Software, [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), Dalian, China. He is affiliated with the research groups led by Prof. [Hongfei Lin](https://ir.dlut.edu.cn/info/1031/1092.htm) and Prof. [He Jiang](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/jianghe/zh_CN/index.htm).

Pior to that, he obtained his Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the [OSCAR Lab](http://oscar-lab.org/eng/index.htm), [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), , where he was supervised by Prof. [He Jiang](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/jianghe/zh_CN/index.htm). 

As a professional member of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [IEEE](https://www.computer.org/), and [CCF (China Computer Federation)](https://www.ccf.org.cn/), his research interests center on Software Analysis and Testing
, with specific focuses on:
* Compiler testing and validation
* Automated software fault localization techniques
* Large-scale software data analysis and visualization
* Artificial intelligence applications in software engineering (AI4SE)
